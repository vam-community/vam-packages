# Virt-A-Mate Packages

This repository contains a shared list of hosted packages, as an alternative to creating your own repositories and to archive scripts that were only available through reddit.

## File structure

Place files in `Scripts/{Author}/{package}/{...file}`, where `{Author}` and `{package}` match the [Virt-A-Mate Scripts Registry](https://github.com/vam-community/vam-registry).
